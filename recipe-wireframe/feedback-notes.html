I meet with Julia and we showed each other our wireframes.

I want to make my header a full screen page with a fixed 
	background with title (the name of the food "Chinese 
	Crispy Meatpie"), and when the user scrolls down, the 
	bottom sections comes up and covers the fixed 
	cover/header section.

Julia suggests that I have to make sure that if I add any
	text in the header, I need to make ure that the text 
	is fixed, so that when the user scrolls up the text is 
	covered together with the background. So I decided that
	I will make the text part of the picture by using
	Photoshop.

	We both want to make Chinese food and both want to add 
	Chinese in the title, but I searched online and found 
	that there are very limited webfonts for Chinese. So 
	adding the Chinese text in the picture by Photoshop
	actually helps me to access a diversity of typeface
	choices. 

I ask Julia if I should make my pictures full-screen, because
	i'm afraid that if I make pictures full-screen, they will
	disturb the scrolling experience and interrupt the description
	of precedure. Julia agrees with me. She says when she 
	reads a recipe on a phone, a full-screen photo annoys her 
	and makes her not wanting to read anymore. So I think I
	will prevent using full-screen photos except at the very
	beginning or very end, and leave borders for photos I 
	add between steps. It's better to shrink the photos because
	that's more user friendly.

Also, Julia suggests that I can also add some description after
	or in the header.
