Feedback from Selina to Rose

Hi Rose :) 

I love how you chose The Office as your theme, and the length of the quotes is 
just right to put on postcards. You used a slab serif typeface throughout your 
three postcards, and the general design of the postcards is pretty consistent. 


Several concerns/suggestions:

1. Picture resolution

The resolution of the pictures are not so high, which is probably fine as seen in
the mockup, but when you enlarge them to a full computer screen, this may affect 
how good your design looks.


2. Padding/margin around text

For the first postcard in the first set, the text are touching the edges of the 
pictures, almost bleeding off the borders. This can be an aesthetic choice, but I 
personally don't think slab serif typeface is suitable for this style. So I suggest
leaving more margins around the text. 


3. Text legibility

You can play with some techniques James just showed in class. As the pictures of 
your choise consist of figures/portraits, I think a full or partial gradient is better 
compared to blurring the background. 


4. Placement of text

Be careful with the placement of text. In the first postcard of the last set, the text
is running on top of the character's eyes. In the first postcard of second set, the text
is blocking the character's face. 


Looking forward to see your final design :)


Selina
