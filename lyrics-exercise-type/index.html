			If you want to be my friend<br>
			You want us to get along<br>
			Please do not expect me to<br>
			Wrap it up and keep it there <br>
			The observation I am doing could<br>
			Easily be understood<br>
			As cynical demeanor<br>
			But one of us <strong><span class="misread">misread</span></strong><br>
			And what do you know<br>
			It happened again<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			A friend is not a means<br>
			You utilize to get somewhere<br>
			Somehow I didn't notice<br>
			Friendship is an end<br>
			What do you know<br>
			It happened again<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			How come no-one told me<br>
			All throughout history<br>
			The loneliest people<br>
			Were the ones who always spoke the truth<br>
			The ones who made a difference<br>
			By withstanding the indifference<br>
			I guess it's up to me now<br>
			Should I take that risk or just smile?<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			What do you know<br>
			It happened again <br>
			What do you know
