			<strong>Tender is the night</strong><br>
			Lying by your side<br>
			<strong>Tender is the touch</strong><br>
			Of someone that you love too much<br>
			<strong>Tender is the day</strong><br>
			The demons go away<br>
			Lord I need to find<br>
			Someone who can heal my mind

			Come on, come on, come on<br>

			Come on, come on, come on<br>
			Get through it<br>
			<span style="color: lightcoral">
			Come on, come on, come on<br>
			<strong>Love's the greatest thing<br>

			I'm screwing up my life<br>
			Lord I need to find<br>
			Someone who can heal my mind
