Feedbacks from James:
1. put the picture as the background of the body rather than of the header
2. remove the border and text on the picture, but as a png and as the content of the header, maybe the text can scroll away too (this idea is so exciting)
3. pay attention to the contrast of the picture and text
4. experiment with width: 100vw or height: 100vh

Feedbacks from Julia:
1. the end of the recipe is a little bit sudden (maybe add one more picture? increase the margin/space for the "FINISHED")
2. There's one step with a LOT of text --> big chunk of text not convenient
3. don't recommend splitting the steps - one pic for one step is pretty consistent

Feedbacks from Susannah:
1. Make the title of facts section "Overview"
2. The end font too small (but it looks fine on my phone/computer, I'll recheck that)
3. The step with a lot of text: split by line and see if looks good
4. Ending maybe use picture of the same size/height as the cover page
