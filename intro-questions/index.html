			<li>
				<span style="font-family: georgia"><strong>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</strong>
				<br>
				My name is Selina Wu. I am a sophomore in Communication Design.</span>

			<li>
				<span style="font-family: georgia"><strong>Tell me a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</strong>
				<br>
				Besides the fact that this class is a requirement for my major, I’m curious about what interaction design is and I want to build my own well-designed website for portfolio.</span>
			</li>

			<br>
			<li>
				<span style="font-family: georgia"><strong>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell me a bit about it.</strong>
				<br>
				No. I knew a little about Java, but I don’t know if it will help me in this class.</span>
			</li>		
			
			<br>
			<li>
				<span style="font-family: georgia"><strong>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</strong>
				<br>
				To build a website for myself, which is more fun and design intensive than the website templates online.</span>
			</li>	

			<br>
			<li>
				<span style="font-family: georgia"><strong>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</strong>
				<br>
				I think the difference underlies in interaction, because on paper everything is printed and non-movable, but on the screen I can play with how design elements change over time and over user’s responses.</span>
			</li>	

			<br>
			<li>
				<span style="font-family: georgia"><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</strong>
				<br>
				<a href="zhongguose.com">zhongguose.com</a>>. This website provides the CMYK and RGB codes for traditional colors in Chinese art and culture. I find it effective because when users click on one color, the background of the whole webpage transitioned into that color, thus giving users better sense of what the colors look like. The layout of the webpage is aesthetic, too.</span>
			</li>	

			<br>
			<li>
				<span style="font-family: georgia"><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</strong>
				<br>
				<a href="art.yale.edu">The website of Yale Art Department</a>. The design of the website is debatable, but I think all the categories and sub-categories are nicely laid out, which is very easy for users to browse and find information.</span>
			</li>	

			<br>
			<li>
				<span style="font-family: georgia"><strong>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</strong>
				<br>
				<a href="https://thisisthebrigade.com/">https://thisisthebrigade.com/</a>. This websites demonstrates the combination of both communication and design effectiveness. I love how design elements change while I scroll down, and the color palette and typographical layout are artistic. The designs on each page is also very consistent.</span>
